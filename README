AppleTV TSSAgent - a standalone solution for listing SHSH blobs, fetching SHSH blobs and submitting the blobs to saurik's SHSH server.

Currently this is targeted for the AppleTV but it could definitely be expanded to work with other devices, not that it's necessary.

-l 			 lists all the SHSH blobs that are currently saved on sauriks server.
-v osBuildVersion 	 fetches the SHSH blobs for version specified from apples servers. ie -v 8F455.
-c osBuildVersion 	 fetches the SHSH blobs for version specified from sauriks's servers. ie -c 8F455.
-p osBuildVersion 	 fetch the SHSH blob for the version specified AND pushes to sauriks server.
-1337 			 will fetch the versions that are still elgible to be signed and push them to sauriks server.

yes i am that lazy to just paste the usage output as part of the readme.

anyhow, if you want to build this you need to copy IOKit into $THEOS/include (the local copy of theos if checked out in this folder will not cut it…)

after you make sure that folder is copied

Make

done and done.
